## Generated Documentation
```python
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with the documentation for your Python function `main()`. Here is the information you requested:

**Purpose Summary:** The `main()` function creates a windowed application using Tkinter, with a title, geometry, and background color.

**Parameter Explanations:** None. The function has no parameters.

**Return Value:** None. The function does not return any value.

**Example:** Here is an example of how you could use the `main()` function to create a simple air quality detector application:

This will launch the application when the script is run directly.
